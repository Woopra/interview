# Woopra interview test

Goal is to get all tests passing by 1) implementing the function
`option` and 2) by writing tests to test `attachCampaignData`.

## Getting Started
* Install Node.JS
* Clone this project somewhere
* In the project directory install any dependencies with `npm install .`
* Modify `lib/interview.js` and `test/interview_test.js` to get the
tests passing
* Check your progress by executing `./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha`
